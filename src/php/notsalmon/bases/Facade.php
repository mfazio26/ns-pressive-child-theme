/**
 * This abstract class serves a single purpose. It allows a subclass's instance methods 
 * that are prepended with two underscores ("__") to be accessed via a static method 
 * equivalent. For example...
 *
 * To call `$instance->__is_post_single()` instead you can `PostTypeUtil::is_post_single()`.
 *
 * The intention is, we don't want to have to instantiate and store a new class instance 
 * in every file where the class instance is used. So, instead, the `Facade` will create 
 * a new instance (when one doesn't already exist) and cache it. We then lookup and 
 * retrieve the subclass instance on subsequent static method calls â€“ which ensures that 
 * exactly and only one instance of each subclass type exists at a time.
 *
 * Please note, this is an `Abstract Class` because it should never be instantiated directly. 
 * It should ALWAYS have a subclass.
