 * This class allows us to create a subclass that directly represents a renderable HTML

 * We are intentionally not using WordPress's `get_template_part()` because it has the 
 * unwanted side-effect of making all variables globally accessible...which makes 
 * naming variables way too verbose and opens the door to naming collisions with parent 
 * themes and plugins.
 *
 * By using this setup instead, we can keep all of our processing and variables scoped 
 * to only the subclass that is doing the work. Trust me, its better.
