	 * request is from/to an external location. If they are different, it allows you to 
	 * import the media files. However, if they are the same (ie...127.0.0.1), WordPress 
	 * will refuse to import the files because it believes the files are already in the 
	 * destination. So, we basically have to force WordPress to process each request as 
	 * if it is always an external request.
