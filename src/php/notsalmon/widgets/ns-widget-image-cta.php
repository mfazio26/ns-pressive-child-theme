/**
 * This class creates a custom widget that is intended for the specific use of allowing an image to 
 * be used to either (A) trigger a ThriveBox popup form, or (B) navigate to an internal or external 
 * url. When used in combination with Thrive Themes Clever Widgets, we can pick and choose which 
 * Image CTAs appear on which pages/posts/etc. 
 * 
 * The intention here is to make a more "useable" and "easier to understand" way of performing this 
 * type of action. WordPress's standard `Text` widget isn't capable of parsing shortcodes (which is 
 * how we open a ThriveBox), other plugins don't allow us to "wrap" the output in a shortcode, and 
 * our own NS Shortcode Widget means we are pasting too much raw HTML (and shortcodes) to make it 
 * easily readable. This seems to be the best way to accomplish this type of feature.
 *
 * IMPORTANT:
 * Please note that we are only adding a `title` field directly via this plugin. All other fields 
 * that appear within this Widget are added via the Advanced Custom Fields UI. This drastically 
 * simplifies the process of creating, validating, etc etc. Soooo much easier.
