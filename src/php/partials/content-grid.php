/**
 * content-grid.php
 * Derived from themes/pressive/partials/content-grid.php
 *
 * This file serves a very special purpose. Thrive Themes does not support Focus Areas "between" posts 
 * on archive pages when the layout is set to anything other than full-width. It also doesn't support 
 * those Focus Areas on any archive page other than the `is_home()`. There also isn't a hook we can 
 * use to tap into when the archive list renders or count which post is currently being rendered...so, 
 * we are bypassing that limitation here.
 *
 * The way we do this is â€“ we are proxying the `content-grid.php` template and using that to "count" 
 * which index is currently being rendered. Then, we have created a duplicate `check()` method of our 
 * own (minus the Thrive limitations), and finally calling the `thrive_render_top_focus_area()` to 
 * actually do our rendering. Hopefully, if Thrive ever adds support, we should only have to delete 
 * this template.
